# SSH-Script-Runner
A simple application for running bash scripts on a remote server via ssh

Just a simple project to get back into practice for the start of a new uni year.

A simple application using java swing intended to allow a user to select a directory on a remote server, list the .sh scripts in that directory and then execute any script they want - takes what would be a terminal based operation into a GUI.

Application can be run from the JAR file
